## Overview

Fully responsive pricing component with hover states, simple CSS animation and an option to toggle between monthly and annual rates.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
